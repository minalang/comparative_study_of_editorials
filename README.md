<b>A comparative study of conservative and progressive editorials on COVID-19 relief fund based on appraisal theory</b>   

#### abstract
This paper aims to compare and analyze conservative and progressive editorials on COVID-19 relief funds based on appraisal theory of Martin and White (2005). The study is twofold: one is to classify editorials by positive/negative/neutral stance. As a result, it is found that conservative editorials mostly show negative stance while more than half of progressive editorials show positive stance. The other is to analyze appraisals represent attitude and graduation in the editorials. As a result, attitude appraisal in both conservative and progressive editorials can be classified into subjects of COVID-19 relief funds. For graduation appraisal, adverb ‘또(tto), again’ emphasizes negative appraisal in both conservative and progressive editorials.
